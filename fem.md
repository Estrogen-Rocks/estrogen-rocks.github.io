These guides involve continuous improvement, trial-and-error, and perseverance. 
You won't get it 100% perfect the first time, and **that's okay.**

### Mother Bats' advice
Practice. There is no magic tip. It will take months. 
You can only do your best and your vocal chords may be too far stretched. 
However, I sang Bass 2 in choir and now have a mostly passing female voice. 
Sing. Read. Watch movies. Go for walks. You may not know what you're doing, but keep feeling around, 
and when you feel something that is a step in the direction you want, keep going in that direction.

Open your mouth wide. Sing. Try not to constrict your throat. Swallow. 
Do you feel your adam's apple moving up? You are trying to keep that up there.

Keep practicing. It will sound horrible. It's supposed to. 
Your voice will get lower and higher as your practice.
