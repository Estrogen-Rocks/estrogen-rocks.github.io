  This document is the sticky of a general thread directed towards feminine males who wish to augment their appearance or delay twink death. However, this is also a great resource for transgirls.
  
  It has sections on makeup, skincare, and fitness.

  Note: It is recommended to change the document mode to `Viewing` as without that you get to see any troll suggestions or edits.
