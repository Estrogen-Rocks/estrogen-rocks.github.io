  <summary>Introspection - Click to Expand</summary>
  <br>
  Take the time to be alone with your thoughts and/or a pen and paper and try and think about how you feel. 
  You don't always need to put your feelings into words or concrete thought. You may not even get a clear answer the first few times. 
  Just keep calm, and take a deep breath. you don't have to know everything about yourself instantly. 
  Self exploration can be tough, but is well worth it in the end.

### Question Distinction

First, let me make the distinction of asking whether or not you are "trans" and whether or not you should transition. 
What do you even mean by "trans?" 
Perhaps you mean "truly identified as the other side"? Or maybe it's just "trans enough to transition." 
You should decide your identity by your own personal feelings and your actions by your circumstances.

### Leap of Faith

Anyway. You can ask a million questions about whether or not you are trans. 
You might tally up all the masculine and feminine things you like, if that makes a difference. 
In the end it will take a leap of faith. Decision are difficult because we don't know the full ramification of them. 
You're worried that maybe you'll transition and regret it. Or maybe you won't transition and regret it. You won't know the future. 
You can bring it to a pretty good guess, but you won't be 100% sure. So relax once you get to 85%.

### What's the worst that could happen? 

If you take hormones and find you don't like it, you get off them. 
If your body is permanently changed a bit, you'll be a little strange, 
that's all. Relax, life is just a ride. 
On the other hand, if you choose not to transition, 
that's fine too, but you'd be left with your imagination of what 
could have been, rather than knowing what could have been.

### What questions to ask

Are you trans? Should you transition? 
No need to ask yourself a million questions of whether or not you like dolls 
or battleships. You don't have to be a girl to hang out with girls. 
Instead, imagine that there is no one else in the world; 
just you and a mirror. 
Do you want to be a man or a woman? 
Does it bring you joy to be called a man or a woman? 
You can still play with dolls and battleships. 
Do you want to be playing with battleships as a girl or a boy? 
Then consider others, not as people, but as an environment. 
Do you want people to call you a woman? 
Treat you as a woman? Expect things of you like a woman? Or a man?

### The Meta

All this back and forth and no clear answers. 
Let's take a step back. 
You've been struggling with this for so long, 
even when you've tried to commit to a life of cis normality. 
This fact shows some significance to it. 
It won't leave you alone. Perhaps you are trans. Or should consider it.


### Pro/Cons Chart
Don't make charts like this.
```diff
-Option 1 Pros | Option 1 Cons
-Money         | No Happiness  
```

Make them like this.
```diff
+Option 1     | Option 2
+Money        | No Money
+No Happiness | Happiness
```
    
### Flip Flop
It's natural to feel strongly about things at some times and feel less at others.

There is a 2nd part to this, but it involves becoming trans after a decision has been made, so it has been placed [here.](https://estrogen.rocks/misc)
