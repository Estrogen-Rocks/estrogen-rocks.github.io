  <br>
  
   Dr. Powers seems to know his stuff, and lots of people report excellent results using his hormone regimen.
   
   He hates Spironolactone, and gives a good reason why. (46:52 in the lecture)
   
   Please watch the entire lecture if you have time, its very informative. If you skip through you will miss useful info.
   
   If you **must** skip ahead, **30:33 - 1:02:00** is where MtF information comes up.
