  <summary>Mother Bats' Trans Service - Click to Expand</summary>
   <br> 
   
   This is the 2nd part of a quick self-help guide by a tripcode user named Mother Bat.
   
   The full copy can be found here: [https://pastebin.com/sM9WB4A7](https://pastebin.com/sM9WB4A7)
   


### Process
So, you've decided to transition! 
The process differs based on your location. 
Maybe you need letters from therapists to get hormones from a doctor. 
Maybe you live near an informed consent clinic and can just ask them. 
To remove facial hair, you have laser hair removal for 
large areas of dark hair or electrolysis for burning out facial hair. 
Go to the gym, get some new clothes, and do what you like. 
Get letters and fill out a packet to go to court and change your name. 
Get letters to see a surgeon, hopefully with insurance. 
United States Medi-Cal does cover Transsexual procedures, 
including hair removal, but it can be difficult getting letters 
that are specific enough to force them to fulfill their end. 
Most surgeons don't accept Medi-cal because they don't pay enough, 
but it is possible to find a surgeon who does, 
or just get your own insurance.

### Skin
Cleanser. Toner. Moisturizer. 
Get a cleanser to clean your face. Get a toner to treat your pores. 
Get a Moisturizer to moisturize your skin.

Or just keep your face clean. Be gentle. Splash water on your face. 
Wipe with a clean towel often.

### Makeup
Primer. It provides a flat foundation for makeup. 
Imagine painting on a rug. It works better on tile.

Foundation. 
Pick a color that matches your skin. 
It can be liquid or powder, your choice. Then you add your shadow bronzers, 
lighter blushes, etc. Imagine if I painted over a flat surface. 
It would look flat. Then I add shadows and highlights. Now it looks 3d. 
That's what you're doing.

Lips. 
You have lip liner for a more durable edge. 
You have lipstick, lip gloss, whatever you like.

Eyes. 
Eyeliner, eye shadow, mascera, etc. 
Find a tutorial. Practice that blending.

Generally, you choose to emphasize your lips or your eyes. 
Doing both looks gaudy. So if you choose colorful eyeshadow, 
you should choose a subtle lip color that matches your lips. 
If you choose bright red lips, you should go easy on the eyes.

### Hair
You can try all the nutrients and oils. If you are healthy, 
your hair will be healthy. Stop smoking! 
Your hair will grow as best it can. Genetics may be involved.

Don't damage your hair. Don't crush it, 
twist it, or get it tangled and bent. 
Every once in a while, get a trim on the ends to remove split ends.
Try not to heat or chemical your hair too often. 
You don't have to wash your hair often. 
You can just use conditioner. However, if you do use shampoo, 
you must use conditioner afterwards.

### Eyebrows
Relax. Get a magnifying mirror and needle point tweezers. 
Pluck one hair at a time. Find the main core of your eyebrow, 
the shape you want. Then you remove the forest of stray hairs 
outside of that area. Generally, you pluck from the bottom 
and don't touch the top. You want to keep that arch.

### Sideburns
Shave your sideburns back to your ear!

### Voice
Practice. There is no magic tip. It will take months. 
You can only do your best and your vocal chords may be too far stretched. 
However, I sang Bass 2 in choir and now have a mostly passing female voice.
Sing. Read. Watch movies. Go for walks. 
You may not know what you're doing, but keep feeling around, 
and when you feel something that is a step in the direction you want, 
keep going in that direction.

Open your mouth wide. Sing. Try not to constrict your throat. Swallow. 
Do you feel your adam's apple moving up? 
You are trying to keep that up there.

Keep practicing. It will sound horrible. 
It's supposed to. Your voice will get lower and higher as your practice.

**[[EDITORS NOTE]]**

If you want to hear her voice, she recently had a conversation with another 
tripcode user which was posted online. The intro is long, skip ahead one minute.

**[[EDITORS NOTE]]**


### Mannerisms
Create a character you want to emulate. Small dainty woman? Confident woman?
Do things to help you get into character. 
Watch movies. Listen to music. Recite lines from movies.

Keep your feet close together when walking or sitting. 
Keep your hands together when sitting. You are small; 
you do not take up much space. You wait patiently and move smoothly, 
not in sudden jerking fashion. Keep your hands open, 
as if energy would flow down your arms like water.
