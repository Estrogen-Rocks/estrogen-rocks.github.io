  <summary>Mother Bats' Coming Out Service  - Click to Expand</summary>
  <br>
  
  ### Should You Come Out
  Why would you want to come out? Oh yeah, it's nice to have people know who you really are. 
  You'd like to live authentically and don't want to hide anymore or can't. 
  What if there are obstacles?
  
  #### Old People
  If your grandparents are homophobic or transphobic and are close to dying, is it worth the trouble? This one is entirely up to you. I have nothing to add.
  
  #### Work
  Work is important. Money is important. Maybe relationships with your coworkers are important.
  Maybe your ambiguity confuses customers and you need to pick a side. 
  But what if they are prejudiced? Again, you'll have to judge the risk.
  
  ### How to come out
  
  #### Probing
  How can you quietly gauge someone's level of tolerance for /lgbt people? 
  Talk to them about an /lgbt movie. The following is a bit of a clumsy and tasteless move, 
  but you could pretend to be homophobic and transphobic, or at least skeptical of them. 
  Ask them what they think about groups that oppose /lgbt, such as religions, countries, or 
  people. Get into a curious philisophical debate about where to draw the line of live and 
  let live; pretend it's purely academic. Consider the tolerance of other 
  fringe lifestyles or cultural customs.
  
  **[[EDITORS NOTE]]**
  
If your family watches movies often, here are some lgbtq movies to probe them with.

#### Call me by your name
- Cute gay love story
- Timothee Chalamet (My Husband)
- Possible excuses:
  - Almost an academy award winner for best picture.
  - Timothee Chalamet.

#### Dallas Buyers Club
- Deals with gay and trans people during the 80's aids epedemic.
- Has a trans main character
- Possible Excuses
  - Mattew Mcconaughey

#### Portrait of a lady on fire.
- 18th century lesbians
- Possible Excuses (If your parents know what cannes is)
Nominated for Palm d'Or.
Won Best screenplay at cannes.

**[[EDITORS NOTE]]**
  
  #### The Approach
  If you want to put more effort into a long con, you can warm them up by earning their respect. 
  Be good at your job, greet them when you see them, and perhaps offer them lunch or 
  small gifts or favors. You could try to persuade them to be more liberal with live and 
  let live. Freshen up on your persuasion skills! Go see Google.
  
  #### The conversation
  Go on and make it a formal approach. You can be relaxed about it, 
  but do tell them that you need to tell them something important. 
  I suppose you could afford to casually mention it if it isn't important, 
  if the subject is not important, or if there is low risk. T
  hen you tell them that you're homosexual or transgender. 
  Answer their questions and address their concerns.
  
  Have the answers to the following questions: 
  
  - What this means for your lifestyle?
  - How you know you're gay/trans?
  - How you "became" or did not become trans?
  - Assure them that you are still a good person.
  - Assure them that you are still the same person.
  - Dispel their misconceptions about gay and trans people.
  
  Throw them a bone; agree with them in some things, like how children cannot be touched 
  and sex should be kept private, or that you still believe in God.
 
  Tell them that you know it is a lot to take in and will understand if 
  it takes them a while to get used to it.
  
  If they don't react well, don't lash out. You can calmly retort or you can stay silent. 
  Don't lash out. It's pointless and makes things worse if bridges are ever to be repaired.
  
  ### Don't come out
  If you can't come out, I'm sorry. You'll have to find a way to cope and rationalize. 
  You have to live for yourself. Not everyone gets to have a loving family. 
  Yes yes, this you know. It still hurts. This I know. Treat it like a death, 
  lamenting your loss. Maybe it's a little worse, since they're alive and just rejecting you. 
  Well, the version of them that loved you is dead.
  
  #### The Backup Plan
  Come out or not, you may need a backup plan. There's no advice here. 
  Hope to find employment, financial, and government resources to survive. 
  Cultivate friends, prepare safe houses and couches.

  <summary>Mother Bats' Trans Service - Click to Expand</summary>
   <br> 
   
   This is the 2nd part of a quick self-help guide by a tripcode user named Mother Bat.
   
   The full copy can be found here: [https://pastebin.com/sM9WB4A7](https://pastebin.com/sM9WB4A7)
   


### Process
So, you've decided to transition! 
The process differs based on your location. 
Maybe you need letters from therapists to get hormones from a doctor. 
Maybe you live near an informed consent clinic and can just ask them. 
To remove facial hair, you have laser hair removal for 
large areas of dark hair or electrolysis for burning out facial hair. 
Go to the gym, get some new clothes, and do what you like. 
Get letters and fill out a packet to go to court and change your name. 
Get letters to see a surgeon, hopefully with insurance. 
United States Medi-Cal does cover Transsexual procedures, 
including hair removal, but it can be difficult getting letters 
that are specific enough to force them to fulfill their end. 
Most surgeons don't accept Medi-cal because they don't pay enough, 
but it is possible to find a surgeon who does, 
or just get your own insurance.

### Skin
Cleanser. Toner. Moisturizer. 
Get a cleanser to clean your face. Get a toner to treat your pores. 
Get a Moisturizer to moisturize your skin.

Or just keep your face clean. Be gentle. Splash water on your face. 
Wipe with a clean towel often.

### Makeup
####Primer. 
It provides a flat foundation for makeup. 
Imagine painting on a rug. It works better on tile.

####Foundation. 
Pick a color that matches your skin. 
It can be liquid or powder, your choice. Then you add your shadow bronzers, 
lighter blushes, etc. Imagine if I painted over a flat surface. 
It would look flat. Then I add shadows and highlights. Now it looks 3d. 
That's what you're doing.

####Lips. 
You have lip liner for a more durable edge. 
You have lipstick, lip gloss, whatever you like.

####Eyes. 
Eyeliner, eye shadow, mascera, etc. 
Find a tutorial. Practice that blending.

Generally, you choose to emphasize your lips or your eyes. 
Doing both looks gaudy. So if you choose colorful eyeshadow, 
you should choose a subtle lip color that matches your lips. 
If you choose bright red lips, you should go easy on the eyes.

### Hair
You can try all the nutrients and oils. If you are healthy, 
your hair will be healthy. Stop smoking! 
Your hair will grow as best it can. Genetics may be involved.

Don't damage your hair. Don't crush it, 
twist it, or get it tangled and bent. 
Every once in a while, get a trim on the ends to remove split ends.
Try not to heat or chemical your hair too often. 
You don't have to wash your hair often. 
You can just use conditioner. However, if you do use shampoo, 
you must use conditioner afterwards.

### Eyebrows
Relax. Get a magnifying mirror and needle point tweezers. 
Pluck one hair at a time. Find the main core of your eyebrow, 
the shape you want. Then you remove the forest of stray hairs 
outside of that area. Generally, you pluck from the bottom 
and don't touch the top. You want to keep that arch.

### Sideburns
Shave your sideburns back to your ear!

### Voice
Practice. There is no magic tip. It will take months. 
You can only do your best and your vocal chords may be too far stretched. 
However, I sang Bass 2 in choir and now have a mostly passing female voice.
Sing. Read. Watch movies. Go for walks. 
You may not know what you're doing, but keep feeling around, 
and when you feel something that is a step in the direction you want, 
keep going in that direction.

Open your mouth wide. Sing. Try not to constrict your throat. Swallow. 
Do you feel your adam's apple moving up? 
You are trying to keep that up there.

Keep practicing. It will sound horrible. 
It's supposed to. Your voice will get lower and higher as your practice.

**[[EDITORS NOTE]]**

If you want to hear her voice, she recently had a conversation with another 
tripcode user which was posted online. The intro is long, skip ahead one minute.

**[[EDITORS NOTE]]**


### Mannerisms
Create a character you want to emulate. Small dainty woman? Confident woman?
Do things to help you get into character. 
Watch movies. Listen to music. Recite lines from movies.

Keep your feet close together when walking or sitting. 
Keep your hands together when sitting. You are small; 
you do not take up much space. You wait patiently and move smoothly, 
not in sudden jerking fashion. Keep your hands open, 
as if energy would flow down your arms like water.
